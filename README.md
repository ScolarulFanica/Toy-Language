🖥️ Toy Language Interpreter in Java 🚀
Welcome to my Toy Language Interpreter project! This repository contains a Java-based implementation of a simple interpreter for a toy programming language, created as part of my university studies. 🎓

🛠️ Features
Custom Expressions & Statements: Execute basic and complex operations using custom-defined syntax. 🧩
Type System: Includes robust handling of various types and values. 🔧
Garbage Collection: Implements a basic memory management system for efficiency. ♻️
Exception Handling: Comprehensive management of runtime and logical errors. ⚠️
📂 Project Structure
The project is modular and organized into packages for clarity and scalability:

Controller (controller/)
The brain of the interpreter! Handles execution flow and bridges the components. 🕹️

Model (model/)

Statements & Expressions: Implements the core logic of the toy language. 📜
ADTs (Abstract Data Types): Structures like stacks and dictionaries for state management. 🗂️
Types & Values: Encapsulates the language's type system. 🔢
Program States: Tracks execution states for accurate interpretation. 🧮
Repository (repository/)

Stores and manages program states.
Contains the Garbage Collector for efficient memory use. 🗑️
Exceptions (exceptions/)
A collection of custom exceptions for robust error handling. ❌

Main
The entry point to start and showcase the interpreter. 🚪

💡 How It Works
Write a program in the toy language syntax.
Load it into the interpreter using the controller.
Watch it execute step by step, handling variables, control flows, and more. 🧑‍💻
✨ Future Enhancements
🌍 Expand the language's syntax and features.
🔍 Add debugging and visualization tools for better user experience.
🧹 Optimization with synchronization
